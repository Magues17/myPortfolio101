    Hello there! I'm a Network Engineer looking to transistion to Software Developer, and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you.

I was born and raised in Houston, and I have always had a passion for developing new things. 

I pursued my interests by developing networks and building out the internet. 

My current postion allows me to do what I love every day, and I feel incredibly grateful for that.

In my free time, I enjoy learning about the other side of development "Software". 

I'm also a big fan of Web Design and Game Development.

I find that these activities help me to relax and recharge, and they allow me to connect with others who share similar interests.

I believe that life is about learning, growing, and making a positive impact in the world. 

I strive to live my life with purpose and to make a difference in the lives of those around me.
